## Overview

`realworld-web` is the **consumer UAT surface** for CAP-01..CAP-06 and CTR-01..CTR-06: guest bulletin browse (global feed, article open, tag lanes, public profiles); contribution-seat lifecycle UI (register eligibility, login seat, logout unseat, re-login reseat); seated tagged markdown publish/revise/delete; private favorites shelf; own nameplate self-update — with product-level denial visible when unseated or peer-attacked. Wave0a kill paths are proven on this client against `realworld-api` in `realworld-local` compose.

**Out of this repo:** API provider truth and fail-closed persistence (`realworld-api`); local compose/DB join (`realworld-local`); comments, follows, personalized feeds, OAuth, public who-favorited proof, drafts/moderation, password recovery, account deletion, admin roles.

**Ownership:** this spec states observable web product behavior, acceptance, field meaning, invariants, errors, and compatibility only. Implementation architecture (React/Redux module layout, routing, token storage mechanism) is **not** decided here — routed to feasibility / technical review.

## Out of scope for this repo

- API provider persistence, auth token issuance, and fail-closed server rules — **realworld-api**
- Local compose / DB join for live prove — **realworld-local**
- Comments (legacy UI present under `src/components/Article/*Comment*`; not a Wave0a CAP/REQ)
- Follow / unfollow graphs or follower counts (legacy Profile follow chrome)
- Personalized / “your feed” timelines (legacy `Articles.feed` / Home feed tab)
- Email verification gates; OAuth / third-party identity
- Public who-favorited social proof (counts or actor lists as social proof — legacy `favoritesCount` display)
- Draft or moderation queues; durable server-side drafts
- Password reset / recovery; account deletion / data-export programmes
- Admin / moderator / staff tooling
- Multi-device session cascade beyond “explicit logout unseats *this* session” (OQ-05 / IM-05 deferred)
- Mid-read live push after delete (OQ-09 / IM-09 deferred — next navigation / reopen sufficient)
- Mobile or native clients

## Non-functional requirements

| Area | Requirement or N/A rationale | Acceptance / evidence |
|------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Security | Contribution seat must keep publish / favorite / profile self-update closed to Guests and post-logout actors as a product rule (REQ-12, REQ-14, REQ-18, REQ-29, REQ-32). Credential verification fail-closed in UI (REQ-11). Peer nameplate mutation denied (REQ-31). No OAuth in this INIT. | unit + live seat-denial paths |
| Reliability | N/A beyond fail-closed UAT behavior — not a multi-region SLA INIT. Incomplete actions must not leave partial publish / shelf / nameplate success observable in the UI. | inspection / negative-path tests |
| Performance / capacity | N/A for Wave0a UAT scale; no concurrent-load target locked. | N/A |
| Observability | N/A as product kill criterion; client logging remains an engineering concern. | N/A for product acceptance |
| Privacy / data handling | Private shelves isolated across members in the UI (REQ-25, REQ-27). No public who-favorited proof. Shelf must not resurrect deleted articles (REQ-33). Nameplate exposes bio/image as public; username/email identity-locked. | live (J-13, J-16) |
| Migration / compatibility | Clean-slate Wave0a — no prior tenant corpus migration required. Legacy gothinkster React+Redux Conduit under `src/` is baseline source, not a guaranteed as-built product surface until proven against CAP/REQ. | as-built / feasibility |
| Rollback / recovery | N/A as product REQ — delivery rollback is engineering. | N/A |
| Operations / support | Live prove environment is `realworld-local` compose (out of this repo); web must target local API for Wave0a prove (REQ-36). No 24×7 support envelope locked. | live kill-path prove |

## Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Evidence | Owner | Status | Invalidated when |
|----|------------|----------|-------|--------|------------------|
| A-01 | Registration uniqueness covers username and email both unique | PRD A-01; IM-01 default | PM | confirmed (Wave0a default applied) | OQ-01 reopened with different uniqueness set |
| A-02 | Markdown is the authored body format; readable published content is the kill bar (not pixel-perfect renderer parity) | PRD A-02 | PM | confirmed | Rich media beyond markdown becomes in-scope |
| A-03 | Author delete removes public bulletin presence; shelf must not resurrect public readability | PRD A-03; IM-08 | PM | confirmed | Public resurrection via shelf allowed (would break REQ-33) |
| A-04 | Explicit logout defines unseat for Wave0a; idle-timeout not required | PRD A-04 | PM | confirmed | Idle timeout becomes a kill criterion |
| A-05 | Tags are author-chosen free-form labels; blank tokens rejected; ≥1 non-blank required | PRD A-05; IM-02 | PM | confirmed | Curated taxonomy replaces free-form |
| A-06 | Reseat on successful re-authentication is in scope | PRD A-06 | PM | confirmed | Reseat removed from kill path |
| A-07 | Inter-member shelf isolation is required (including UI non-exposure of peer shelves) | PRD A-07 | PM | confirmed | Privacy redefined as “no public proof” only |
| A-08 | Unfinished compose has no durable server-side draft; client scratch must not publish on abandon/unseat | PRD A-08 | PM | confirmed | Server drafts become in-scope |
| A-09 | As-built index is absent; source under `src/` is legacy gothinkster React+Redux Conduit (includes out-of-scope comments, follows, “your feed”, public favorites tab, favoritesCount) | Source scan 2026-11-11; empty `docs/specification/as-built/`; `src/agent.js` defaults to third-party demo API; overlay Dockerfile rewrites to `http://localhost:3100/api` | PE | open | As-built index published with capability rows |

## Spec questions (ambiguities — need PM or domain confirmation before feasibility)

| ID | Lane | Question | Owner | Blocking | Required by | Default if deferred | Status | Resolution link |
|----|------|----------|-------|----------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Q-01 | PM | Registration field/uniqueness set (OQ-01 / IM-01) | PM | no | feasibility | Unique username + unique email + password; bio/image via nameplate | resolved | Impact-Map IM-01 default → REQ-08/REQ-09 |
| Q-02 | PM | Tag normalization limits (OQ-02 / IM-02) | PM | no | feasibility | Free-form; reject blank; ≥1 non-blank tag | resolved | Impact-Map IM-02 default → REQ-16/REQ-22 |
| Q-03 | PM | Nameplate editable vs identity-locked (OQ-03 / IM-03) | PM | no | feasibility | Bio/image editable; username/email locked | resolved | Impact-Map IM-03 default → REQ-30 |

## Draft check summary (D1–D12)

| Check | Status | Evidence / findings |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| D1 Approved handoff current | PASS | H1 digest matches PRD file; H3 map_revision=1; H2 web scope digest present; G1 APPROVED review `commit_id` = meta PR #5 head `a500df8e…`; label `impact-map-lgtm`; repo affected not deferred |
| D1b No open blocking IM-* | PASS | Impact-map §10: no `Blocking: yes` open rows; IM-01..IM-04, IM-06..IM-08 defaults applied into REQs |
| D2 Complete PRD traceability | PASS | CAP-01..CAP-06 each have ≥1 REQ; every REQ cites PRD CAP/REQ or OQ/IM default / Lock 9 |
| D2b Journeys carried | PASS | J-01..J-19 carried; live evidence cites CAP/J |
| D3 Repo-bounded scope | PASS | Consumer UAT scope matches impact-map H2; api/local and non-goals listed under Out of scope |
| D4 Observable acceptance | PASS | Each REQ has condition/event, observable result, evidence layer; implementation-neutral |
| D5 Negative/failure paths | PASS | Table covers unseated, ownership, zero-tag, shelf privacy, delete/not-found, abandon |
| D6 Assumptions/questions | PASS | Assumptions evidenced; questions have lane/owner/blocking/default/status; material PM defaults applied |
| D7 Cross-repository contracts | PASS | CTR-01..CTR-06 semantic seams with provider=api, consumer=web |
| D8 NFR applicability | PASS | All eight areas specified or N/A with reason |
| D9 As-built alignment | PASS | As-built index absent; source scan notes legacy Conduit under `src/` (existing baseline with out-of-scope chrome) vs Wave0a CAP/REQ obligations (new prove surface); overlay already rewrites API root for local prove |
| D10 Dependency order | PASS | Matches impact-map: api → web → local; web depends on api |
| D11 Zero unresolved blockers | PASS | No blocking Q remaining; Q-05/Q-09/Q-10/Q-11 non-blocking with defaults |
| D12 Output completeness | PASS | Header H1–H3/G1, tables, check summary, outcome, PR readiness, handoff present |

**Draft verdict:** PASS

**Selected workflow outcome:** `pass`
**Outcome reason:** D1–D12 PASS, Gate 1 current, zero unresolved material questions, IM defaults locked into REQs, PR READY for Forge publish.

Do not advance to `/initiative-feasibility` unless the workflow outcome is
`pass`, the draft verdict is PASS, and the developer review below is complete.

## PR readiness handoff

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Workflow outcome | `pass` — D1–D12 PASS; Gate 1 current; material IM defaults applied |
| Verdict | PR READY |
| Existing spec PR | none open (historical CLOSED: https://github.com/drivestream-lab/realworld-web/pull/1) |
| Proposed branch | `chore/INIT-REALWORLD-001-spec-realworld-web` |
| Proposed base | `develop` |
| Proposed title | `[INIT-REALWORLD-001] Spec — realworld-web` |
| PR type | **Draft** (entire spec lifecycle) |
| Local artifacts to publish | `docs/specification/product/INIT-REALWORLD-001-web.md`, `docs/specification/README.md` |
| Forge readiness | fill `handoff.forge` for `open_draft_pr`; recommend `/commit-workspace` then `/open-draft-pr` — do not commit/push/open PR inside this skill |
| Reviewer | @drivestream-lab/frontend-devs |
| Initial Gate 2 label | `spec-pending` |
| Additional invalidation label | none |
| Blocking items | none |

**No GitHub side effects have occurred.** Persist the draft locally; Forge publish is a later `/commit-workspace` / `/open-draft-pr` or Gateflow ForgeClient step.

### Proposed Draft PR body

```markdown
## Initiative

INIT-REALWORLD-001 — Public bulletin with session-bound contribution seat

## Meta handoff

- Meta PRD PR: https://github.com/drivestream-lab/realworld-meta/pull/5
- Approved meta head: `a500df8eeefbea095ecdd65e00edb128416c3cf4`
- Impact-map revision: 1
- PRD digest: `sha256:cdc1f66d5cf4c1f12fd0f9ed8bf28d320d4aef941d6abbb0612f53886a1fcfb4`
- Repo scope digest: `sha256:0124a41f5c7c3acba48e93564e5cc8cb84f218d6f7b863c27a98bfc3fcfb7549`

## Spec path

`docs/specification/product/INIT-REALWORLD-001-web.md`

## Summary

- 36 REQs covering CAP-01..CAP-06 as web consumer UAT surface for CTR-01..CTR-06
- Wave0a kill-path prove on web against local API; api/local out of scope
- Open non-blocking engineering questions: Q-05, Q-09, Q-10, Q-11

## Gate 2 — spec package readiness

Initial label: `spec-pending`

- [ ] Spec slice published on this PR head (via Forge `/commit-workspace` / `/open-draft-pr`)
- [ ] Feasibility report (later Forge publish)
- [ ] Technical design + ADRs (later Forge publish)
- [ ] Implementation plan §9 (later Forge publish)
- [ ] PE sets `spec-lgtm` on exact final head before merge

Requested reviewer: @drivestream-lab/frontend-devs
```

## Developer review

- [ ] Scope matches the approved impact-map repo scope digest
- [ ] REQs have condition/event, observable result, and evidence layer
- [ ] Contracts are semantic (logical operation); no architecture decisions in REQs
- [ ] No blocking question remains
- [ ] Developer confirmed draft is ready for feasibility

## After Draft PR creation

PE controls Gate 2 labels on the spec PR. Never infer approval from labels
alone — `spec-lgtm` requires matching artifacts on the exact PR head.

Provision labels before PR creation when missing:

```bash
launchpad apply-gates --repo realworld-web --apply
```

| PE action | Remove | Add |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Pending/new revision | `spec-lgtm`, `spec-blocked` | `spec-pending` |
| Request changes/hold | `spec-pending`, `spec-lgtm` | `spec-blocked` |
| Approve full package | `spec-pending`, `spec-blocked`, `spec-revised`, `spec-stale` | `spec-lgtm` |
